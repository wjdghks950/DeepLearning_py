# DeepLearning.py

This repo contains codes for RNN (language model, seq2seq), 

CNN (MNIST, Image classification) and  simple linear regression codes.

# Python 3.6.1

Python 3.6.1 or higher is a prerequisite for the codes to run.

If you have a lower version of Python installed on your computer,

make sure to use "from __future__ import" to use functions from higher versions 

of Python.
